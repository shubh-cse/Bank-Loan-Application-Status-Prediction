# Bank Loan Application Status Prediction

*A Machine Learning Web App built with Flask*

# Problem Statement

*The loan default dataset has 8 variables and 850 records, each record being loan default status for each customer. Each Applicant was rated as “Defaulted” or “Not-Defaulted”. New applicants for loan application can also be evaluated on these 8 predictor variables and classified as a default or non-default based on predictor variables.*

# Data Set
